# etap
api for calling etap to create, analyze, and export power system analysis using ETAP 22

## The following functions have been tested:

### (1) Result export
export results from PF1R, i.e., SQLite database, to excel file
### (2) Run power flow
using etap.api to run power flow


## The following functions are going to be implemented

### (1) Modify the conditions
using scenario function
### (2) Create new components using api
The problem is that, the connection can not be implemented automatically, i.e., the Bus property of the given element.
### (3) Create the whole system from scratch
